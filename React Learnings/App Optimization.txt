Understand the Virtual DOM / How React is updating its UI
--------------------------------------------------------------

When a component renders, React creates a Virtual DOM or generating the element tree in the component.
Now whenever the state of the component chnages, react recreates a virtual DOM tree and compares the result with the prev result and it will only update the changes in actual element by comparing actual element with virtual DOM (Diffing)

React uses the VIRTUAL DOM its minimize the preforance cost of re rendering a webpage. 
when the state change state changes its re render


React.memo is the higher order component which is used to wrap a purely functional component to prevent re rendering if the props reveived in that component which is not changed

<input> Changed S, SO, SON, SONA, SONAM

<COunt> chnage 1,1,1,1,1 (if count changed ? no then don;t render


useMemo Hook helps us to avoid re-computing the expensive calculation in a perticular componet. 

Basicall helps to memoize the values and only re-compute when the dependency change.

useMemo(()=>{},[])

Code Splitting using React Dynamic import
-----------------------------------------------
very important and optimization technique.

import Home from '../ ';


<Home />
<Aboou />


const About = React.lazy(()=>import("./components/About"));
