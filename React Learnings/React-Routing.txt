Routing
----------------------------

React is a SPA (Single Page Application) Means all the components are going to render in only one component like parent component which is app.js

Means based on the links if you wnat to render diffrent components then we can take the help of routing.

Routing helps us to create navigations links

localhost:3000/login
localhost:3000/register

to make this links we can use one library react router dom.

>npm i react-router-dom

once it is installed we can start using the same in our application.

================================================================================

<BrowserRouter> component available in the react router dom which actually using HTML5 history API to keep UI in sync with the URL.

it provides th context of routing and also enables diffrent routing components like Routes, Route.
Thats why its suggested to put all Routes and Route tags inside the browserrouter tag otherwise you want be able to route with the links.

--> it creates a history object and also keeping our UI in sync and work with the created URL by rendering the components based on the current location.

<Routes> is a component used to wrap multiple routes inside the same. (its a replacement of switch component of old version react-router-dom)
 --->its including the features like relative routing and linkings, automatic route ranking, nested routes and layout.
 
<Route> resoponsible for rendering the UI of React component.

its having 2 props
	1. path: which is always matches the current URL of the application
	2. element: it tells the route component when the current URL is encountered which components needs to be rendered
		(element is updated keyword of component)
